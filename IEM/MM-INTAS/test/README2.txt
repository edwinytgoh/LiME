 1- TEST CASES
---------------

Three test cases are considered here:

. test0: only mixture fraction is considered (enough to test micro-mixing
         models on one scalar)

. test1: chemical composition and density are deduced from mixture fraction
         by using a look-up table.
         The look-up table './methane_noreact/methane.fldata' corresponds
         to a case of pure mixing of methane (mixture fraction = 1) in air
         (mixture fraction = 0) at a temperature of 298K. It was generated
         by the tabulation program 'FLAME' (from TU Delft).
         In the directory: './methane_noreact', the files '_CPM', '_RHO', ...
         give the properties tabulated as function of mixture fraction
           CPM,  specific heat
           RHO,  density
           TEMP, temperature
           YCH4, mass fraction of CH4
           YCO,  mass fraction of CO
           ...

. test2: chemical composition and density are deduced from mixture fraction
         by using a look-up table.
         The look-up table './methane_fulleq/methane.fldata' corresponds
         to the same case as before when reaction is considered. The chemistry
         model used is a full equilibrium chemistry model. The look-up table
         was generated by the tabulation program 'FLAME' (from TU Delft).
         In the directory: './methane_fulleq', the files '_CPM', '_RHO', ...
         give the properties tabulated as function of mixture fraction
           CPM,  specific heat
           RHO,  density
           TEMP, temperature
           YCH4, mass fraction of CH4
           YCO,  mass fraction of CO
           ...

 2- CONTROL FILES
------------------

~~~~~~~~~~~~
2-1- GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The control files:
. 'control.test0'
. 'control.test1'
. 'control.test2'
contain the names of input and output files for each test case

Note: the name of the file should start at character 30
E.g.
                             |
                             V
123456789012345678901234567890
input file                  :HOME/test0.input


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2-2- FILES SPECIFIED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inputs:
. 'input file' is the input file for the calculation (see 3- INPUT FILES)
. 'FLAME datafile' is the file needed in the case that a look-up table is
   used (cases test1 and test2)

Outputs:
. 'output file' is just an output containing information over the calculation
  that was performed
. 'log file' keeps a trace on which subroutines are called
. 'PDF output file' is the root for the names of the ouput datafile
  (see 5- OUTPUTS)



----------------
 3- INPUT FILES
----------------

In the input files for each test case, 'test0.input', 'test1.input' and
'test2.input', parameters can be changed. E.g:
. number of particles considered
. time-step
. micro-mixing model
...
Those input files should be self explanatory.



--------------------------------------------
 4- DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE THREE TEST CASES
--------------------------------------------

For test0 we specify that only mixture fraction is considered by setting
the keyword 'CASE' in the input file to the value 0.
For test1 and test2 we specify that the methane case is considered by setting
the keyword 'CASE' in the input file to the value 1.

test1 and test2 are different because different look-up tables (specified
in the control file) are used.



------------
 5- OUTPUTS
------------

The data output files are generated every 'IPDFOP' iteration (IPDFOP is
specified in the input file).
Their names are
  <output><iteration>
Where <output> is specified in the control file ('PDF output file')


The information is:
  particle number,   value of independent scalars,   value of dependent scalars
The first lines give the names of independent and dependent scalars


From this information PDFs can be postprocessed.



----------------------------
 6- HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM?
----------------------------

../exe/MM-INTAS < controlfile

(the information contained in the control file is read in the program from
the standard input).
